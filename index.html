        <h2>My life Story</h2>
          <p1>My name is George Washington.I come from the Nyanza part of Kenya where
            I live with my parents.I am born and raised in Migori county a place called Sori.
            I have four siblings and I am the third born.<br>
          </p1>
          <p2>I am writing my story to inspire young people especilly those coming from
            a humble background not to give up in their quest to become great and fulfil their 
            dreams. Always remember that the sky is the limit.Never listen to nay sayers and
            always commit all your plans and work to God.No one can define your life except you:
            you hold your destiny through your daily habbits and routines, allow me to make
            a refference to <a href="http/:www.mahatmagadhi.com">Mahatma Gadhi</a>quotes that
            "You become great by doing small things in a great way".
